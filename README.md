This is a library for Learning to Rank (LTR) with PyTorch.
The goal of this library is to support the infrastructure necessary for performing LTR experiments in PyTorch.

## Installation

In your virtualenv simply run:

    pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/rjagerman/pytorchltr.git#egg=pytorchltr

Note that this is a Python 3 only library.
